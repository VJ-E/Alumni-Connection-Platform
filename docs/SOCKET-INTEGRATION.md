# Socket.IO Integration with Next.js

## Overview
Successfully integrated the separate Socket.IO backend server into the main Next.js application, eliminating the need for two separate backends.

## Changes Made

### 1. Custom Server Implementation
- Created `server.js` - A custom Next.js server that handles both HTTP requests and Socket.IO connections
- Updated `package.json` scripts to use the custom server instead of default Next.js dev server

### 2. Socket.IO Server Integration
- Created `lib/socket.js` - Contains all Socket.IO server logic migrated from the old backend
- Features preserved:
  - Real-time messaging between users
  - Group chat functionality
  - Typing indicators
  - Connection state management
  - MongoDB integration for message persistence

### 3. Client-Side Updates
- Updated `contexts/SocketContext.tsx` to connect to the integrated server
- Changed connection URL from separate backend to main Next.js server
- Updated Socket.IO path from `/socket.io/` to `/api/socket`

### 4. API Route
- Created `app/api/socket/route.ts` - Placeholder API route for Socket.IO endpoint

### 5. Cleanup
- Removed the entire `realtime-backend/` directory
- Removed unnecessary TypeScript socket file

## Architecture

### Before (Two Backends)
```
Next.js App (Port 3000) ←→ Separate Socket.IO Server (Port 3001)
```

### After (Single Backend)
```
Next.js App with Integrated Socket.IO (Port 3000)
```

## Configuration

### Development
```bash
npm run dev  # Runs custom server with Socket.IO
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build
npm run start  # Runs custom server with Socket.IO
```

## Socket.IO Features

### Real-time Messaging
- Direct messages between users
- Message persistence in MongoDB
- Message confirmation and error handling

### Group Chat
- Multi-user group conversations
- Group membership validation
- Real-time group message broadcasting

### Connection Management
- User presence tracking
- Automatic reconnection
- Connection state recovery
- Graceful disconnection handling

### Typing Indicators
- Real-time typing status updates
- Per-conversation typing indicators

## Environment Variables
No additional environment variables needed. The Socket.IO server automatically detects the environment and configures CORS accordingly.

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Deployment** - Only one server to deploy and manage
2. **Reduced Complexity** - No need to manage two separate backends
3. **Better Resource Utilization** - Single Node.js process handles both HTTP and WebSocket connections
4. **Easier Development** - Single command to start the entire application
5. **Cost Effective** - Reduced hosting costs with single server deployment

## Testing

The integration has been tested and verified:
- ✅ Next.js server starts successfully
- ✅ Socket.IO endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ Client-side connection configuration updated
- ✅ All Socket.IO features preserved

## Migration Notes

- The Socket.IO client automatically connects to the main server instead of the separate backend
- All existing Socket.IO event handlers and functionality remain unchanged
- Database schemas and models are preserved
- No changes needed to existing frontend components that use Socket.IO
